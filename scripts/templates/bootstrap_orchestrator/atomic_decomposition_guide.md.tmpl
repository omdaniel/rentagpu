# Atomic Task Decomposition Guide ({{WAVE}})

Use this rubric before editing packet files and manifest dependencies.

## Atomic Packet Rules

- One packet should target one coherent objective.
- Prefer 1-4 owned files per packet.
- Avoid overlapping `Allowed Files` across packets that may run in parallel.
- Keep packet validation commands packet-local and deterministic.

## Parallelism Rules

- Packets with disjoint `Allowed Files` and no semantic dependency can run in parallel.
- Encode ordering in `depends_on`.
- `can_run_in_parallel_with` is advisory; `depends_on` is authoritative.

## Dependency Rules

- A packet should depend only on tasks whose outputs it directly requires.
- Keep dependency chains shallow where possible.
- Use a final integration packet to collect cross-cutting updates.

## Packet Completion Rules

- Executor must return `completed` or `blocked`.
- Block when scope must expand beyond `Allowed Files`.
- Include exact failing validation command output on block.
