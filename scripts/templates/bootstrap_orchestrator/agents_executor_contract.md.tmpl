## Orchestrator/Executor Contract

When executing packetized refactor tasks:

- Read the assigned packet file under `docs/executor_packets/<wave>/`.
- Edit only files listed under that packet's `## Allowed Files`.
- Run all commands listed under that packet's `## Validation Commands`.
- If task cannot be completed within allowed files, return `blocked` and explain exact blocker.
- Do not commit generated/transient artifacts (`tmp/`, build caches, etc).
- Return status in this format:

```text
[TASK] <ID>
[STATE] completed|blocked
[FILES] <comma-separated edited files>
[VALIDATION] ran: <commands>
[EVIDENCE] <key output lines and skipped-step reasons>
[BLOCKERS] none|<details>
```
