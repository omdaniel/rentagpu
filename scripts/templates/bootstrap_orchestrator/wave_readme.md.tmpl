# {{WAVE}} Executor Packets (Template)

This folder contains packetized tasks for orchestrated refactor execution.

## Execution Contract

- Executor edits are limited to packet `Allowed Files`.
- If required changes exceed packet scope, return `blocked` with precise blocker details.
- Do not add generated/transient artifacts (`tmp/`, build caches, etc.) to tracked files.
- Every packet return must include command-level validation evidence.

## Recommended Dispatch Order

1. Run ready packets with no dependencies in parallel.
2. Promote dependent packets once prerequisites are completed.
3. Run integration gate after all packets complete.

## Required Executor Return Format

```text
[TASK] <ID>
[STATE] completed|blocked
[FILES] ...
[VALIDATION] ran: ...
[EVIDENCE] key output lines + skipped step reason
[BLOCKERS] none|...
```

## Integration Gate

Run from repository root:

```bash
bash scripts/orchestrator_gate.sh
```

## Quota-Aware Orchestration

If Codex API usage limits are hit, use quota controls:

```bash
python3 -B scripts/live_orchestrator.py \
  --manifest docs/executor_packets/{{WAVE}}/manifest.json \
  --quota-cooldown-seconds 900 \
  --quota-max-failures-per-task 3
```
