## Orchestrator Planning Contract

When planning a new wave:

- Build packets under `docs/executor_packets/<wave>/` with one objective per packet.
- Encode hard ordering in manifest `depends_on` and use `can_run_in_parallel_with` only as advisory.
- Keep packet `Allowed Files` disjoint for tasks that should run in parallel.
- Include packet-local deterministic `Validation Commands`.
- Mark packets `blocked` when dependencies are blocked or scope must expand.
- Update `orchestrator_state.md` with packet status and blocker reasons.
