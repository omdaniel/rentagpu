# Refactor Plan ({{WAVE}})

This document defines the planning scaffold for packetized refactors executed by `scripts/live_orchestrator.py`.

## Goals

- Break large refactors into dependency-safe packets.
- Enable parallel execution for independent tasks.
- Enforce strict file-scope and validation gates.

## Non-Goals

- Unscoped architecture redesign.
- Opportunistic cleanup unrelated to packet objectives.
- CI/release redesign unless explicitly packetized.

## Wave Boundaries

- Current wave: `{{WAVE}}`
- Add future waves under `docs/executor_packets/<wave>/` with separate manifests.

## Orchestration Contract

- Machine-readable queue: `docs/executor_packets/{{WAVE}}/manifest.json`
- Packet specs: one markdown packet per task in `docs/executor_packets/{{WAVE}}/`
- Human ledger: `docs/executor_packets/{{WAVE}}/orchestrator_state.md`
- Integration gate: `scripts/orchestrator_gate.sh`
